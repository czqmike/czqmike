### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Nature Language Processing (NLP), especailly **Relation Extraction** (RE) for my master degree.  
âš¡ I implemented a multi-fish recognization and tracking system that you could discover your favorate fishes on the **SURFACE** of your fish boal using `Faster-RCNN` and `Simple Online And Realtime Tracking` (SORT).  
ðŸ˜„ It works well on my poor and old laptop with a NVIDIA 950M.   
ðŸ’¬ If you are interested to me and want to know more about me, welcome to me [blog](http://czqmike-server.cn/) or send messages to me:)
