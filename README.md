### Hi there 👋
🌱 I’m currently learning Nature Language Processing (NLP), especailly in **Relation Extraction** (RE) for my master degree. 
I also implemented a **multi-fish recognization and tracking** system using `Faster-RCNN` and `Simple Online And Realtime Tracking` (SORT).
It works well on my poor and old computer with NVIDIA 950M😄
If you are interested in me and want to know more about me, welcome to me [blog](http://czqmike-server.cn/) :)
